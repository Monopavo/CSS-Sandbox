## Transforms ##

Use "@keyframes" followed by the animation's alias in order to define the animation.
Encapsulate the frames of the animation within curly braces by using the "transform" property. 

EXAMPLE:

```css
@keyframes myAnimationName {
    from { transform: translateX(0); }
    to { transform:translateX(100px); }
}
```

//OR// 

```css
@keyframes myAnimationName {
    0% { transform: translateX(0); }
    100% { transform: translateX(100px); } 
}
```

0% indicates the beginning of the animation, and 100% the end. Any amount of keyframes can be interpolated between them.

Add the animation to the rule with the "animation" shorthand, which consists of...

```css
    animation-name: (Self-explanatory.)
    animation-duration: (The amount of time to complete one animation cycle (in s or ms).)
    animation-timing-function: (Determines the style of easing between keyframes.)
    animation-iteration-count: (How many times the animation is repeated.)
```

All values within the animation are relative to the starting position of the element; translating 200 pixels to the right, and then translating 200 pixels to the left, will NOT return the element to "0"; it will simply translate 200 pixels to the left of 0.





## Transform Values ##

transform: rotate(?deg) // Uses degrees. Rotates the element. Positive is clockwise, negative is anticlockwise.

transform: scale(1) // Uses a point-scale, with 1 being the element's base size. Proportionally increases the height and width of the element. 

transform: translate(x, y) // Uses coordinates. Moves ("translates") the element in the specified axis; X-positive is to move right, Y-positive is to move down.  
transform: translate3d(x, y, z) // Same, but with added z-axis; Z-positive is pushing the element away from the viewer. Requires its parent element to have the "perspective" property.
transform: translateX() // Strictly moves the element along the X-axis.
transform: translateY() // Strictly moves the element along the Y-axis.
transform: translateZ() // Strictly moves the element along the Z-axis.

transform: skew(x, y) // Uses degrees. Distorts ("skews") the element along the X and Y axes.
transform: skewX() // Strictly skews the element along the Y-axis.
transform: skewY() // Strictly skews the element along the Y-axis.





## Timing / Easing Function Values ##

alternate // "Loop". Runs through all 0% => 100% keyframes, then back to 0% in one cycle. 
alternate-reverse // "Ping-pong". Runs through all 100% => 0%, then alternates between starting at 0% and 100% for each cycle.

ease // The default; Starts slow, briefly fast in middle, then slows down.
ease-in // Starts slow, ends fast.
ease-out // Starts fast, ends slow.
ease-in-out // Starts slow, consistently fast in middle, ends slow.

linear // A constant, smooth transition through all frames.

steps(x) // x = total number of keyframes - 1 (basically, excluding 0%). Effectively "pauses" the animation at each frame.





## Cubic Bézier ##

cubic-bezier(c1, c2, c3, c4) // Allows for completely custom timings. Each argument represents a "control point" on a Bézier curve (Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve)...

c1 = Start of timing function, using X-coordinates.
c2 = Start of easing function, using Y-coordinates.
c3 = End of timing function, using X-coordinates.
c4 = End of easing function, using Y-coordinates.

The Bézier curve is (0,0) to (1,1), with each control point having a value between 0 and 1...

Near-0 X // Slower, more gradual pacing; typically smooth.
Near-1 X // Quicker changes in pacing; typically jerky.
Near-0 Y // Stiff, abrupt, jerky easing.
Near-1 Y // Springy, bouncy, smooth easing.

c1 = 0.1 "Slow start" => 1 "Fast start";
c2 = 0.1 "Jerky start" => 1 "Smooth start";
c3 = 0.1 "Slow end" => 1 "fast end";
c4 - 0.1 "Jerky end" => 1 "Smooth end";

With the exception of "alternate" and "alternate-reverse", predefined easings can be made with a Bézier curve...

"Linear" // cubic-bezier(0, 0, 1, 1) // Consistent, linear motion.

"Ease" // cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0) // Standard easing in and out.

"Ease-in" // cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 1, 1) // Starts slow, then speeds up.

"Ease-out" // cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.58, 1) // Starts fast, then slows down.

"Ease-in-out" // cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 0.58, 1) // Starts and ends slow, speeds up in the middle.

Basically, cubic-bezier() is a fine-tuning tool for animations; it is added between the duration and easing / timing functions.





## Iteration Values ##

Either "infinite" or a set number. Defaults to 1 cycle.





## Combining Animations ##

----- Outside of defining different types of transformations and transitions, within the same animation, animations can be combined through the "animation:" property.

----- The animations need to be separated with commas.

EXAMPLE:

```css
.myClassRule {
    animation:
        myAnimation1 5s ease infinite,
        myAnimation2 4s alternate 5,
        myAnimation3 1s backwards 10,
}
```

----- All animations retain their individual keyframe timings and iteration counts, allowing for complex layering. 

----- Using multiple "animation:" properties does not work; the last property will overwrite all the others.

EXAMPLE:

```css
.myClass {
    animation: myAnimation1 5s ease infinite,
    animation: myAnimation2 4s alternate 5,
    animation: myAnimation3 1s backwards 10,
}
```

----- Only the third animation will apply.

----- There can be compatibility issues with the above, so it's best to just define unique animations with all the necessary transforms, transitions, and property changes.

----- For the "transform:" property, this is done by linking all the rotate, translate, scale, and skew values in a single property.

----- Other properties can be chained in the same frame by using a semicolon divisor.

EXAMPLE:

```css
@keyframes myCombinedAnimation {
    0% { transform: scale(1) rotate(0deg); font-size: 14px; color: black; }
    100% { transform: scale(2) rotate(180deg); font-size: 28px; color: red; }
}
```






## Transitions ##

----- Transitions are an easy way of defining simple animations. Instead of using @keyframes, you can define the properties to transition in a pseudoclass, and then add the "transition:" property and all its values in the base class...

EXAMPLE:

```css
myText {
    transition: font-size 5s linear;
}

myText:hover {
    font-size: 30px;
}
```

----- The values of the "transition" property are almost identical to "animation:", but instead of naming an animation, you specify the property to be changed.

----- To chain multiple property changes together, list them within the same "transition:" property, separated by commas...

EXAMPLE:

```css
myText {
    transition: font-size 5s linear infinite, 
    color 2s alternate 5, 
    text-decoration 10s infinite;
}

myText:hover {
    font-size: 30px;
    color: blue;
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```

----- Pseudoclasses like ":active" and ":hover" behave differently when it comes to the "transition:" property...

":active" // Ignores timings, instantly reverting the transition upon releasing a click or removing a finger. 

":hover" // Attempts to smoothly reverse any transitioned properties upon losing the hover state.

----- Basically, use "transition:" to smoothly change the properties of an element during events such as clicks and hovers. For more complex sequences, "animation:" and keyframes provide much greater control.



## Clip-Path ##

----- The "border-radius:" property is used to effectively "round" the corners of an element to create circular shapes, and can also be configured for angular shapes such as triangles, however there is another property that allows for advanced shapes to be created more easily: "clip-path".

----- "clip-path:" is essentially like using a shape-cutter; you have the clip-path serving as a "mould", which is then applied to the element. Every part of the element within the borders of the clip-path is kept, with everything outside of it hidden.

----- The arguments of these attributes are best used with percentile units, save for "clip-path: path*()", which uses its own SVG path expression.

clip-path: inset(%, %, %, %); // Clips an element to a rectangular shape. Up to 4 values (top, right, left, bottom); similar to "border-radius:".

clip-path: circle(%); // Clips an element to a circular shape. 1 value. 

clip-path: ellipse(h% v% at px% py%); // Clips an element to an elliptical shape. 1 horizontal and 1 vertical value, with optional "at" to determine origin of the clip with X and Y values. 

clip-path: polygon(vx vy, vx vy,...); // Clips an element to a custom polygon shape, based on vertices coordinates. Can accept any number of paired x-y values. Can be used to create highly complex shapes, although using more than 20-ish vertices can cause rendering performance issues. Best used with a generator tool, such as [Bennett Feely's "Clippy"](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/).

//// Advanced Values: Need to explore these more ////

path("svg-expression"); // Clips the element based on a SVG path expression.
url("svg-image-location"); // Clips the element based on the path data stored in an SVG image.
none; // Removes any clipping; useful for animations and changes in state.



## Perspective ##

----- It's possible to grant a 3D perspective to 2D elements through the "perspective:" property, allowing for an imitation of the Z-axis. To establish the false Z-axis within a traditional 2D plane of a webpage, the "perspective:" property must be defined in the parent element relative to the child shapes...

EXAMPLE: 

```css
.shape-container {
    perspective: 1000px;
}
```

```html
<div class="shape-container"></div>
```

----- The "perspective:" property's value represents the distance of the parent from its children. Even with responsive design, it's best to use length-based units such as "px" or "em", as using relative units can cause irregular behaviour across devices; 500px to 2000px are the typical ranges.

----- To create the 3D effect, the element must be rotated on the Y-axis with "transform: rotateY()"...

EXAMPLE:

```css
.shape-container {
    perspective: 1000px;
}

.shape {
    transform: rotate(45deg);
}
```

```html
<div class="shape-container">
    <div class="shape"></div>
</div>
```

----- The "perspective-origin:" property, as it name implies, is also placed within the parent container and can be used to adjust the origin point of the perspective; the position where the viewer is seated. It typically uses two X Y values, with these common values:

perspective-origin: 0% 0%; // View from top-left.
perspective-origin: 0% 50%; // View from center-left.
perspective-origin: 0% 100%; // View from bottom-left.
perspective-origin: 50% 0%; // View from top-center.
perspective-origin: 50% 50%; // View from center (default).
perspective-origin: 50% 100%; // View from bottom-center.
perspective-origin: 100% 0%; // View from top-right.
perspective-origin: 100% 50%; // View from center-right.
perspective-origin: 100% 100%; // View from bottom-right.

EXAMPLE:

```css
.shape-container {
    perspective: 1000px;
    perspective-origin: 0% 0%;
}

.shape {
    transform: rotate(45deg);
}
```

```html
<div class="shape-container">
    <div class="shape"></div>
</div>
```

----- As elements are naturally 2D, a 3D animation  consists of a parent container alongside multiple children; for example, a "card" container that has "front" and "back" children, or a "cube" container" that has 6 "face" children, each with their own class or ID for animations. The child elements' transformations can easily break with the default configuration, so "transform-style: preserve-3d;" is also placed in the parent element's rule to preserve them.

----- The "backface-visibility:" property is helpful for retaining a 3D shape during animations, as otherwise it appears as if the element has only been skewed. It's placed within the element's rule, and only takes either "hidden" or "visible" as it's value, with "hidden" being the default. The main issue with backface visibility is that it's strictly binary; it's either "visible" or "hidden", with no gradual changes. For more dynamic and smooth animations, such as flipping a playing card, "opacity:" is favoured over "backface-visibility"...


EXAMPLE:

```html
<div class="container-3d">
    <div id="frame">
        <div id="front">Front</div>
        <div id="back">
            <div id="back-text">Back</div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

                                        /* Card */

```css
#frame {
    width: 20vh;
    height: 30vh;
    border-radius: 5%;
    transform-style: preserve-3d;
    animation: flip-frame 4s linear infinite;
}
  
@keyframes flip-frame {
    50% {transform: rotateY(180deg);}
    100% {transform: rotateY(360deg);}
}
  

/* Faces */

#front, #back {
    position: absolute;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    backface-visibility: hidden;
    transition: 
        opacity 2s ease-in-out, 
        background-color 2s ease-in-out;
}
  
/* Front Face */

#front {
    background-color: orange;
    opacity: 1;
    animation: flip-front 4s linear infinite;
}
  
@keyframes flip-front {
    0%, 25% {opacity: 1;}
    26%, 75% {opacity: 0;}
    76%, 100% {opacity: 1;}
}
  
/* Back Face */

#back {
    background-color: green;
    transform: rotateY(180deg);
    opacity: 0;
    animation: flip-back 4s linear infinite;
}
  
@keyframes flip-back {
    0%, 25% {opacity: 0;}
    26%, 75% {opacity: 1; transform: rotateY(0deg);}
    76%, 100% {opacity: 0;}
}

#back-text {
    transform: rotateY(180deg);
    outline: none;
}
```


----- Essentially...

transform: rotateX() // Rotates the element around the X-axis (front to back).

transform: rotateY() // Rotates the element around the Y-axis (left to right).

transform: rotateZ() // Rotates the element around the Z-axis (flat rotation on the screen).

----- These perspective properties aren't suitable for advanced 3D shaping or animations due to how complex defining the timings and keyframes can get, however they are very handy for lightweight, flipbook-style animations and transitions without requiring library dependencies.




## Scroll ##

----- There are multiple properties that govern scrolling and can enhance the UX of a webpage. First is "scroll-behavior:", which only has two possible values...

scroll-behavior: auto; // Instantly scrolls to the new position. The default value.
scroll-behavior: smooth; // Animates the scroll effect, creating a smooth transition.





----- The most influential properties are "scroll-snap-align", "scroll-snap-type", "scroll-snap-stop", "scroll-padding", and "scroll-margin"...





----- "scroll-snap-align:" determines the "snap points" that are used to enforce specific scroll behaviours. They are placed at key positions where you would want a user to pause or slow down, such as a <section> on a webpage, or a header in a lengthy <div>. It takes up to two of four possible values, with the first value being horizontal alignment and the second being vertical alignment. If one value is used, then it applies to both...

scroll-snap-align: start; // Aligns the snap point to the start of the container.
scroll-snap-align: center; // Aligns the snap point to the center of the container.
scroll-snap-align: end; // Aligns the snap point to the end of the container.
scroll-snap-align: none; // No snapping behavior.





----- "scroll-snap-type:" determines how the snap points 

scroll-snap-type: AXIS PROXIMITY;

AXIS = x // Snaps horizontally.
AXIS = y // Snaps vertically.
AXIS = both // Snaps in both directions.

PROXIMITY = mandatory // Always snaps to the defined points; a "strict" and "abrupt" snap. Useful for galleries, carousels, etc...
PROXIMITY = proximity // Snaps if scrolling is close to a snap point; a "loose" and "smooth" snap. Useful for subtle, gentle pauses in lengthy content sections.





----- "scroll-snap-stop:" is similar to scroll-snap-type's "mandatory" and "proximity" values, however it is more explicit. Its somewhat binary nature makes it suitable for JavaScript manipulation without needing to alter the scroll-snap-type property. It takes two possible values...

scroll-snap-stop: always; // Strictly enforces a stop at each snap point. 
scroll-snap-stop: normal; // Uses the values within "scroll-snap-type".




----- "scroll-padding:" is applied to the scroll container (a div, section, etc.) that has scroll items. It adds padding within the scroll container, ensuring that its scroll items with snap points don't snap too close to the container's edges. It has the same values as the traditional "padding:" property. Essentially, it's a "buffer zone" that prevents the items from touching the container.





----- "scroll-margin:" is applied to scroll items (headers, paragraphs, images, etc.) that have been given a "snap-align" point. It ensures that the user's scrolling snaps a comfortable distance from any trailing or advancing content. It has the same values as the traditional "margin:" property. Essentially, it's like a "buffer zone" that extends the range of the snap.





----- There are also a couple of other properties that interact with scrolling and the scrollbar, such as...

overflow: auto; // Adds scrollbars if needed.
overflow: hidden; // Hides overflow content.
overflow: scroll; // Always adds scrollbars.

scrollbar-color: color1 color2 // Determines the color of the scrollbar. The first color is the thumb (the "draggable part"), and the second is the track (the "background" part).

scrollbar-width: auto; // Default scrollbar width.
scrollbar-width: thin; // A thinner scrollbar.
scrollbar-width: none; // Hides the scrollbar.
